## Lucian's dotfiles

What began as a way of keeping my Vim setup in one place has expanded into a
method of keeping my personal command line and development setup in one place.
Vim will work best with version 7.3+

### Installation

```
git clone https://lbuzzo@bitbucket.org/lbuzzo/vim-setup.git .dotfiles
cd .dotfiles
npm install -g
```
