## Lucian's dotfiles

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LucianBuzzo/dotfiles.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/LucianBuzzo/dotfiles)

What began as a way of keeping my Vim setup in one place has expanded into a
method of keeping my personal command line and development setup in one place.
Vim will work best with version 7.3+

### Installation

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:LucianBuzzo/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
cd .dotfiles
npm install -g
```
