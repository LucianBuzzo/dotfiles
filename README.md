## Lucian's dotfiles

[![CI](https://github.com/LucianBuzzo/dotfiles/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/LucianBuzzo/dotfiles/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

What began as a way of keeping my Vim setup in one place has expanded into a
method of keeping my personal command line and development setup in one place.
Vim will work best with version 7.3+
